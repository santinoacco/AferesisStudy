 ## Overview
 
 In this project I go over a medical dataset to assert the effectiveness of a novel apheresis method.
 Employing basic statistical technics such as hypothesis testing and linear regresions I conclude that the introduced method is highly superior than its predecessor,
 resulting in a 42(5)% efficiency increase, a 33(9)% increase in security (reduction of toxicity) and an estimated annual savings of 12.3(4.1)k u$.
 All of this carried out using Python3, SciPy, NumPy and others.
